By 1853, Britain’s Sir George Cayley created a glider with fixed wings, cambered airfoil, and horizontal and vertical stabilizers. Continuing Cayley’s work, German engineer Otto Lilienthal produced flying machines similar to today’s hang gliders. From 1891 until his death five years later, Lilienthal greatly advanced aerodynamic theory. The publicity generated by Lilienthal spurred on imaginative people on both sides of the Atlantic, including Orville and Wilbur Wright.</p>"

From 1900 to 1902, the Wrights conducted more than 1,000 glides from Kill Devil Hills near Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. After perfecting wing warping, elevators and rudders, and a water-cooled engine, they attempted the first powered flight on 14 December 1903. On that try, the aircraft stalled upon takeoff and crashed three seconds later. Success came at 10:35, on 17 December 1903, when Orville Wright flew 120 feet in 12 seconds. Alternating pilot duties, the brothers made three more flights with Wilbur flying 852 feet and staying aloft 59 seconds on the fourth attempt.</p><div class='hb-image-wrap-right shadow'><img src='/Assets/images/handbook/handbook-pic3.jpg' class='col p-0'><div class='col hb-image-caption'>The enlisted men of the 1908 Aeronautical Division Left to right (back row), Pfc.

Langley’s steam-powered Aerodrome in October 1903. Although a highly respected scientist and Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, Langley and the Army were subjected to public ridicule and Congressional criticism for the “waste” of a $50,000 government grant. Only when President Theodore Roosevelt intervened was an aeronautical division established in the United States Army’s Signal Corps on 1 August 1907.</p><p class='hb-p'><span class='hb-bold-text'>1.2.6.</span>With the establishment of an aeronautical division the army was in possession of several balloons. The Army required trained enlisted men to conduct balloon inflations and effect necessary repairs. Effective 2 July 1907, Eddy Ward and Jason Barrett reported to the Leo Stevens’ balloon factory in New York City. They would become the first enlisted men assigned to the Signal Corps’ small Aeronautical Division, which in time evolved into the United States Air Force enlisted corps.</p><p class='hb-p'><span class='hb-bold-text'>1.2.7.</span>When Ward and Barrett reported, the division did not officially exist. The Army had disbanded the minuscule Civil War balloon service in 1863, and the corps’ attempts to revive military aviation met with little success. At the balloon factory, the two men were schooled in the rudiments of fabric handling, folding, and stitching; in the manufacturing of buoyant gases; and in the inflation and control of the Army’s “aircraft.”</p>"

Over the next few years, the detachment participated in numerous air shows and moved from location to location. Barrett left the Army to complete a career in the Navy, but the enlisted detachment was soon expanded to include eight others. These nine men were the nucleus from which America’s enlisted air arm grew. They were the first of a small band of enlisted Airmen who, during the decade before World War I, shared in the experimental and halting first steps to establish military aviation as a permanent part of the Nation’s defense. Never numbering more than a few hundred individuals, the enlisted crews of the Signal Corps’ Aeronautical Division provided day-to-day support for a handful of officer pilots, learned the entirely new skills of airplane “mechanician”—and later, mechanic, rigger, and fitter—met daunting transportation and logistical challenges, and contributed mightily to the era’s seat-of-the-pants technological advances.</p><p class='hb-p'><span class='hb-bold-text'>1.2.9.</span> A few enlisted men, against official and semi-official military prejudice, learned to fly. The majority of enlisted men were absorbed in the tasks of getting the fragile balloons and even flimsier planes of the day into the air and keeping them there. Of necessity flexible and innovative, early crews often had to rebuild aircraft from the ground up after every crash—and, in those early days of flight; crashes were the rule rather than the exception. Enlisted crews not only repaired the planes, they labored to make some of the more ill-designed craft airworthy in the first place.</p><div class='row hb-title-container'><div class='col-0 hb-title-square'></div><div class='col hb-title'>1.3.

The flying machine had to carry two people (with a combined weight of 350 pounds or less), and fly for 125 miles at an average speed of 40 miles per hour (mph). The Army received 41 bids, but only one, submitted by the Wright brothers, produced a flyable aircraft. By September 1908, the Wright Type “A” Military Flyer flew for more than an hour at a maximum altitude of 310 feet, carrying the first military observer, Lieutenant Frank P. Lahm. A subsequent test on                  17 September 1908 resulted in the first military aviation fatality: Lieutenant Thomas E. Selfridge. On 30 July 1909, pilot Orville Wright and Lieutenant Benjamin D. Foulois flew from Fort Myer to Alexandria, Virginia, at an average speed of 42.6 mph. The Army accepted the plane 2 August 1909 and awarded the Wrights $25,000 and a $5,000 bonus.</p>"
